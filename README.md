# MyReads Project

This is the final project of the React Fundamentals module and focuses on React and its state management.
In the MyReads project, I have created a bookshelf app that allows to select and categorize books into three categories: 
1. Books I have read, 
2. Books I am currently reading,
3. Books I want to read (oh, there are so many)

The books can be moved from shelf to shelf as well as new books can be added from a search page.
